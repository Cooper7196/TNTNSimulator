# Product Guidelines

## Documentation Tone and Style
All documentation and user-facing text should be clear, concise, and practical, aimed specifically at developers. The language used should facilitate understanding of the simulator's functionality and API, enabling efficient development of robot control algorithms.

## User Interface (UI) Design Principles
The UI design will prioritize simplicity and ease of use. Functionality will take precedence over elaborate aesthetics, ensuring that developers can quickly and intuitively interact with the simulator without unnecessary distractions. The focus will be on providing a streamlined experience for testing and debugging algorithms.

## Error Handling and Debugging
The simulator will provide clear and actionable error messages. These messages should be designed to guide users in identifying and resolving issues efficiently, minimizing frustration during algorithm development and testing.

## Internal Usage
This tool is intended for internal team use only. Therefore, external community engagement, public forums, or dedicated customer support channels are not required.
